\section{Character Creation \rep}

One player is the Kid. They narrate for themselves, the monster, and all NPCs.

All other players create a character from one of three factions: Civilian, Scientist, or Military.

Everything the Kid says in-character about the monster is true. Nobody else knows this at first.

Determine at least one B-plot before play begins. Every player involved in a B-plot must approve of it.

\subsection{Example Characters}

Create your own, choose from this list, or roll 1d6:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The intrepid reporter
	\item The ordinary blue-collar worker
	\item The old-coot science expert
	\item The plucky science assistant
	\item The grizzled four-star general
	\item The brave soldier
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Example B-Plots}

Create your own, choose from this list, or roll 1d6:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item International tension
	\item Someone stole something
	\item Reporters or spies on the trail of something
	\item Construction of a power plant, road, etc. is threatened by the monster's presence
	\item Romance or rivalry between characters
	\item Aliens are invading or infiltrating Earth
\end{enumerate}

\vfill\null % if the text isn't compressed enough, use this to "fill" the rest of the column

\columnbreak

% now we put in some vertical space, which depends on your font and title, to account for the overlapping minipage. Note the dot.
{\color{white}.}
\vspace{18mm}

\section{Playing the Game \rep}

The monster starts the game with 3 HP.

The Kid narrates the current threat of the monster, while other players narrate the reactions from themselves or their faction as a whole.

\textbf{When anyone hatches a plan to defeat the monster}, describe it and roll 1d6.

If you spent a scene advancing any B-plot, or introduced drama to an existing plot, add +1d6 to the roll per distinct contribution. If anyone hammed it up, add +1d6 per ham.

Look for the highest roll on any of the dice.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item [1-3:] It fails. A player from another faction (e.g. Scientist when a Military player rolled) must come up with an explanation of why.
	\item [4-5:] The monster develops a new bullshit power, nullifying the plan. Any player can make suggestions, with the Kid's player having the final say.
	\item [6:] Mark 1 HP off the monster. The player who rolled describes the outcome.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Examples of Hamming It Up}

A Civilian interfered with the plan for some selfish or venal motive.
A Scientist horribly mangles real-world science.
The Military brags about the power of their new weapons.
The Kid is allowed to run wild through an off-limits area.

\subsection{Safety Check}

This is a game about giant monsters terrorizing cities. Everyone has their own ideas about what this means, including the original filmmakers. If the game isn't fun for you because of the material or the other players, speak up. If someone speaks up, stop and listen. Everyone's fun and comfort matters more than finishing the game.

\columnbreak

\section{Finishing the Game \rep}

Once the monster is at 0 HP, it is killed, driven off, etc. Resolve any lingering B-plots. If there is a sequel:

\begin{itemize}
\item A different player becomes the Kid
\item The monster returns from its defeat, but is now on the side of humanity
\item Devise a new threat for this monster to fight
\end{itemize}
